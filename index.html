                        <p>I love the outdoors! Whether it’s hiking, biking, or skiing, I’m just happy to be out in nature. I particularly enjoy hiking as it presents an opportunity to slow down and appreciate everything around you. I have been lucky enough to explore many areas across the nation; these experiences have had a large impact on my life. In fact, I am moving to Seattle after graduation for better access to nature. Unfortunately, my favorite pastime is under threat from climate change.</p>

                        <p>It is probably no surprise that an activity so closely linked to nature is affected by climate change. More specifically, hiking is highly dependent on weather. Within our communities, we have various systemic and technological barriers that shield us from the effects of inclement weather. We can shelter from storms in the safety of our houses and tap into municipal reservoirs to survive a drought. These protections are much more limited when hiking. Climate change increases the likelihood of negative weather events and endanger the viability of hiking.</p>

                        <p>One impact of climate change prominent in Maryland is flooding. Coastal areas are the most severely affected due to sea level rise, but even upland areas are seeing an increase in these events. Due to climate change, extended periods of precipitation have become more common in Maryland. The water produced in these events can overwhelm rivers and flood into outlying areas. The attached picture shows the Potomac River roaring through Great Falls Park after several weeks of heavy rain. That particular event washed out large sections of the Billy Goat Trail, a popular hiking destination along the river. Similarly, the flooding event that devastated Ellicott City also caused the closure of many areas in Patapsco State Park. These extended precipitation events are projected to become even more frequent as climate change continues.

                    <div class="col-xs-8 text-side">
                        <p>On the other end of the spectrum, less frequent precipitation poses a problem as well. In the western US, climate change is causing many areas to be warmer and drier. This impacts the rain and snow events that those places rely on for water. Although it may be a bit difficult to discern, the associated picture shows a reservoir near Reno, NV during a drought. The brighter strip around the edge of the reservoir shows the pre-drought water line. For hikers, drought conditions require much more careful water planning when backpacking. In mountains like the Rockies or Sierra Nevada, it is common to resupply water from ephemeral streams fed by snowfields higher on the mountain. During years with poor snowfall, these ephemeral streams can dry up early in the season or simply vanish altogether. With improper planning, backpackers may find themselves without a water source several days into a trip.</p>

                        <p>Poor snowfall and higher temperatures pose yet another danger: avalanches. Shallower snow is generally less stable than deeper snow since it lacks the additional mass to compact the base layer. When the temperature rises, and the snow begins to melt, it can detach from the underlying ground and plummet downhill. Avalanche season begins earlier each year due to the aforementioned precipitation and temperature changes. Unaware hikers have ventured into avalanche zones and lost their lives doing what would have been safe only a few years prior.</p>

                        <p>Perhaps the largest impact of climate change on hiking is the increased prevalence of wildfires. Higher temperatures and decreased precipitation cause forests to dry out and become susceptible to ignition. In the western US and many other parts of the world, “fire season” has become a regular and increasingly longer occurrence. Unsurprisingly, there is a large overlap between popular hiking spots and wildfire hazard zones. In some cases, the fires are even caused by the irresponsible actions of hikers. The associated picture shows several trees that burned in the 2017 Eagle Creek Fire in Oregon. Prior to the fire, the Eagle Creek area was a popular hiking destination featuring beautiful waterfalls and dense, verdant forest. The fire began when a teenager set off fireworks on one of the trails as a prank. Now, much of the previously forested area is a sea of charred tree trunks, and most hiking trails remain closed. Trail closure from fire damage is unfortunately common in wilderness areas, and climate change will continue to make these closures even more common.</p>

                <div class="row entry">
                    <div class="col-xs-8 text-side">
                        <p>Outside of trail closures, wildfires have an even larger effect on hiking through smoke pollution. Smoke from the fires can travel vast distances and inundate otherwise unaffected areas. People in populated areas have to deal with this problem as well, but it is generally worse for hikers. Popular hiking areas tend to be closer to fire danger zones and the geography that makes an area fun to hike also serves to trap the smoke in the surrounding area. The associated picture is from a hike near the Teton Valley in Idaho. The mountains in the background were partially obscured by smoke from wildfires in Washington; you can easily see the cloud of smoke blowing in from the western part of the valley. At the end of the hike, I had to wipe a small layer of soot off my skin and clothes. Hiking through smoke is not recommended due to the various health risks it poses. Even ignoring that, hiking in smoke is unpleasant as it irritates your eyes and throat. As climate change causes forests to be more and more susceptible to fires, these unpleasant hiking conditions will only grow more common.</p>

                        <p>The risk of wildfires can be mitigated through controlled burns. Although US policy has only favored controlled burns relatively recently, the technique was previously used extensively by Native Americans. Controlled burns prevent the buildup of dry, flammable material and are even required for some species of tree to reproduce. The associated picture shows the effects of a controlled burn near Shenandoah National Park. When done correctly, the technique removes built up underbrush without heavily damaging the larger plants. Of course, controlled burns only address climate change indirectly by reducing one very specific consequence of it. It would be better to combat climate change directly.</p>

                        <p>One technique for combating climate change is by reducing one’s carbon footprint. Carbon dioxide, like other greenhouse gases, prevents more energy from radiating into space and results in a net increase in global temperature. Vehicles represent a large portion of the CO2 released into the atmosphere, so driving less is a good way to lower your carbon footprint. Hikers must do their part in order to continue enjoying the activities they love. Although hiking itself is a very low carbon activity, hikers often drive long distances to reach wilderness areas. For this reason, it is a good idea for hiking groups to carpool whenever possible.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-8 text-side">
                        <p>Another way hikers can reduce their carbon footprint is to take public transportation. Although it is true that wilderness areas are generally not accessible through such services, there are many more options than one might think. Many localities have public transportation that connects to hiking areas, and the trend is becoming more common. I took the associated picture near Boulder, Colorado, and I took public transportation all the way to the trailhead. Similarly, Seattle has several public shuttles that go to the Cascades foothills. If an area does not currently provide such a service, it is possible to lobby the local government to implement it. With enough support, public transportation trailhead access can be a great means of carbon footprint reduction.</p>

                    <div class="col-xs-8 text-side">
                        <p>I love hiking, and I have no idea what I would do if it were no longer an option. Unfortunately, I can see that⁠—without intervention⁠—climate change will drastically reduce the quality of hiking within my lifetime. Whether it is flooding, fire damage, or smoke, climate change will take its toll. It’s not entirely hopeless though; we can still take action! Controlled burns help to combat the wildfires that plague hikers. Better yet, hikers and others can reduce their carbon footprints through carpooling and public transportation. Best of all, we can use the mountains and rivers that make hiking so enjoyable to develop nonpolluting energy sources. Hikers like myself have a lot to lose to climate change and just as much to gain from combating it. I think the choice should be clear.</p>
